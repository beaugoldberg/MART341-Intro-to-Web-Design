                “We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires
                —we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome. We do not 
                think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favourable: we do not
                succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires
                change. The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes
                unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely
                determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn
                round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has 
                it become.”

            <h3>Kafka On The Shore<pre class="date">(2002)</pre></h3>
            <p class="p1">
                “Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn’t something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn’t get in, and walk through it, step by step. There’s no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That’s the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.
                And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You’ll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.
                And once the storm is over you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”

            <h3>Different Seasons<pre class="date">(1982)</pre></h3>
            <p class="p1">
                “The most important things are the hardest to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them — words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they’re brought out. But it’s more than that, isn’t it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away. And you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you’ve said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it. That’s the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.”
