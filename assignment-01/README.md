Beaus' MART341-Intro to Web Design
Week 2: This week I did a general overview of file types, directories and github. 
It was a rather broad overview of all the different topics so there werent any issues during the process. 
I think its helpful for me to see these ideas again and read more specifics into each topic to get a deeper 
understanding how the things we work with work on a deeper level. I enjoyed the broad overview in general and 
think it will be a good resource to go back to for information in the future if any questions arise.
