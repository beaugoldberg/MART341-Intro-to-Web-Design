# Homework 6: Recipe Page

- Each page should have only one <head> and <body> tag. If you are using more than one
  you should be working on a different page as that information clearly doesnt apply to the information
  displayed on the first page.

- Structural Markup handles the structure of the document with paragraphs and lists whereas Semantic Markup 
  handles emphasizing what is important on the page using bold or italics to give certain words more draw from 
  the user.

- Im not 100% sure what is meant by work cycle but for this assignment I went about it by reading through the 
  website to read about the details and tags in html. After reading through and looking at some of the resources
  I began making the web page in visual studio code. I tried to make as much of the file as i could from memory to
  test what i have learned and then looked back at the website to recheck any ideas that i didnt catch the first
  time around and implemented them. By doing this i feel it tests the knowledge that i have and then by seeing 
  what I wasnt sure about twice it solidifies the idea a bit more in my mind. I repeated this process to fill
  out the webpage and complete it along the guidlines.
