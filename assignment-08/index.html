                [Verse]
                The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
                I dreamed I held you in my arms
                But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
                And I hung my head and cried

                [Chorus]
                You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
                You make me happy when skies are grey
                You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
                Please don't take my sunshine away

                [Verse 2]
                I'll always love you and make you happy
                If you will only say the same
                But if you leave me to love another
                You'll regret it all some day

                [Chorus]
                You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
                You make me happy when skies are grey
                You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
                Please don't take my sunshine away

                [Verse 3]
                You told me once, dear, you really loved me
                And no one else could come between
                But now you've left me and love another
                You have shattered all my dreams

                [Chorus]
                You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
                You make me happy when skies are grey
                You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
                Please don't take my sunshine away
