1. The HTML in this project was great review for solidifying the processes that we've learned so far. The nav tag was new and I liked how that made 
    navigation between pages much easier and look nicer. I worked a bit more with basic styling which was new and fun to learn. I think the vastness
    of things you can do in html and with css makes it a bit intimidating but learning it is fun. There is just a lot to learn but that is a good thing!

2. I'm very excited to hopefully learn a bit more into how wepages make their interfaces so cool and intriuging. Especially hopefully learning how some 
    of the more unique websites work to make fun and exciting user interactions and experiences. Because im so interested in the abstract and different 
    I want to learn how to make unique and exciting webpages. So im looking forward to if we do any of that. Also learning more styling in general and 
    different ways to set up a page is exciting. Its making me look forward to working on personal projects in the future.

3. This assignment went rather well. I was able to implement most of it without to much hassle. I ran into some trouble centering the images and dealing
    with making the homepage look good to the user. It's not perfect but i feel the solutions i implemented were decent in making it presentable. Finding
    where to implement the table in the form was a little hard as it didnt seem to fit anywhere really well but I was able to modify the presentation of the 
    neccesary files to put it there which i think worked out okay. At first i was a little nervous reading the homework topic because it seemed like a lot but 
    it was fun to come up with an idea and make something out of it. Once i got started it came along pretty smoothly which was cool.
