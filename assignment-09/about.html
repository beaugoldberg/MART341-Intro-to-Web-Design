            <h3>Why NavMesh in Unity 3D</h3>
            <p>
                The reason that i decided to make this instructable is because I just learned this overall process myself and felt
                it would be a cool guide to implement in this format. Its a process that is relatively simple but without the proper 
                resources or direction is nearly impossible to implement. Therefore creating a place where the resources and step by
                step guide can be in one place seemed like a good idea. This is relevant to me as im navigating my way through learning
                new processes in Unity. Having tutorials and guides of this nature are incredibly helpful to learning new things and I
                thought I'd try to make my own.
