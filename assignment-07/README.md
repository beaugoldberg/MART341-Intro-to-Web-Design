# Homework 7: Business Contact Page

1. Forms are seen all across the web whether it be creating an account for a site, submitting feedback or search inquiries. They allow 
    for the site to gather information from the user about them and thier credentials or what they are looking for. It allows for 
    user interaction with the webpage and its tools.

2. Textbox example: Google Search Bar
        Used to gather user input as to what they want to search for then uses that user input to search thier database and return information
   
   Selection example: Captcha Verifications
        Uses selection techniques to allow the user to select a specific image or set of images to verify they are not a bot

   Button example: Submit or Login Buttons
        Used to send the user inputed information back to the web server for processing. Is required for the transaction of information

3. I began drafting the document by creating each of the required parts of the assignment in the order they were presented on the homework sheet.
    After this I looked at what could be combined together and the order in which it should be ordered for best user experience and then 
    combined them properly. Then I dealt with specific styling issues to make the page look a bit more formatted and easy on the users eye.
