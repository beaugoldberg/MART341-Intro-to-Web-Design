2. I came across many challenges this week becuase I basically built my entire Web Server Site this week. Along the lines of this homework i guess the homepage caused
    many styling challenges when I was trying to figure out how I wanted to set it up. Making sure everything was properly centered and sized and located where I wanted them was
    tricky at first but I learned quickly how to troubleshoot and toy with it till I got stuff to where I wanted. I looked up a lot of resources as well to help me so that was helpful in learning exactly how to control everything. Was extremely fun overall though and its really cool to have a finished product like this!
